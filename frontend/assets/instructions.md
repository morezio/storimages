# ðŸ’» Development notes
At the moment we only support a single function :( but we hope to expand features soon! If you find any bug, please [report it through email](mailto:m@morez.io). Provide us some context and if possible the date and time of the error. 


# ðŸ“œ Privacy notice
We won't sell your data and we won't make any other use of the pictures you upload other than resizing them.

Just to make sure and be as transparent as possible, the system will keep original and any new pictures with different dimensions that we generate for you until the admin has time to set up a policy of deletion (hopefully in 1 week).

This is solely because of system design and the current phase of development. Eventually, files lifecycle will be bi-weekly, that is, all the pictures will be deleted after 2 weeks starting to count down from the first time we process a given file. This is in case we receive the same picture twice for the same dimensions, reduce the cost of reprocessing.

Rest assured your data is safe and we are making our best to keep it safe. However, please, don't upload any private pictures or pictures of people of which you don't own the copyrights or have their explicit consent.

Thank you for choosing StorImages. Please, [provide any feedback to us by email](mailto:m@morez.io).
