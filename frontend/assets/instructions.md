âœŒðŸ¤  Howdy! We are pretty excited to have you around to test out the very first edition of StorImages

# âš  Important
Make sure that both the zip and the files you upload:
- **DO NOT** have spaces or scores in their names. Use underscores --->>> _
- **DO NOT** have any dot (other than the one for the extension, of course)
- **Are not** big (no more than a few megabytes, plz). This is a test version, so, although it might be able to handle big files, don't try it out just yet :)
- If you upload a zip, **make sure the zip is not corrupted** since currently we don't support fixes to corrupted zips :(

# ðŸ¤” Instructions
1. Drag and drop or click the dashed area to upload a zip or any of the supported formats
2. If you don't upload a valid file (a zip or a supported file format) no submit button will appear
3. System will display a window with all the files that will be processed
4. Choose any of the currently supported preset sizes
5. Press submit

If you submit a zip, a zip of thumbnails will be returned. If you submit a picture, only the new picture will be returned.
